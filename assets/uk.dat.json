    "4": "Your death will be avenged!",
    "10": "The pathetic leader of this bunch of scum is trying to escape.",
    "11": "He probably understood he wouldn't stand a chance against us.",
    "12": "Let's leave this stinkin' place. I'm sick of it!",
    "13": "Who are these guys?",
    "14": "We are the Snuff Elite Squad. You won't leave this place alive unless you defeat us!",

    "209": "You! So, you survived the plane attack!",
    "210": "What! You were behind this!",
    "211": "You brainless ball! This is deeper than you think. You shouldn't have disturbed the high council plans.",
    "212": "What plans? What high council?",
    "213": "I've wasted enough time with you. So, you won't mind if I leave.",
    "300": "I must compliment you. I didn't think you would make it so far. However, your journey ends here. I'll take care of you myself!",

    "521": "It is indeed! But you won't enter! You must not disturb the masters!",
    "522": "The masters? Tell us who they are or we're going to kick your ass!",
    "523": "You don't stand a chance, because I'm one of them. I'm known as the Dorkemons� trainer.",
    "524": "Ok, let's kick their asses first then!",
    "525": "Lazy artists... It really pisses me off!    ",
    "526": "These guys have no respect for anything at all!",
    "600": "How did you enter? What have you done to my husband?",
    "601": "Looks like you've recently divorced.",
    "602": "You are not welcome here!",
    "603": "You!",
    "604": "Yes it is I! Dario! Dario the plumber!",
    "605": "I would never have thought a stupid plumber would make such a mess...",
    "606": "After many years fixing broken toilets for appalling wages, I had had enough. Naturally I then planned to take over the world, so I created the high council with the help of my brother!",
    "607": "You should have stayed in your toilets in the first place.",
    "608": "That's where you belong, you piece of shit.",
    "609": "How dare you say that to the future ruler of the world?! I'm gonna kill you with my bare hands!",
    "610": "Dario, let me take care of these bastards!",
    "611": "Yeah, sure! Once you've killed them, go to the Big Mama's place. I'll be expecting you there.  ",
    "612": "And what's coming next?",
    "613": "Let me guess... A hedgehog?",
    "614": "That's what I call fate...",
    "615": "Hedgehogs always die under the wheels of a car.",
    "700": "There's no escape for you this time!",
    "701": "What did you expect by hiding yourself here?",
    "702": "You're clueless. I'm not trying to escape or to hide. I'm about to reach my goal.",
    "703": "You're insane. Your armies are all destroyed; the high council is no more. What can you do on a useless stone drifting in space?",
    "704": "Drifting? Not for long, I'm going to change its course in order to strike planet earth itself!",
    "705": "You mean... you're going to destroy the whole planet?",
    "706": "Yeah! Since I'll never be the ruler of this world, I'm going to destroy it.",
    "707": "You're totally insane!",
