This is the source code of Blip'n Blop, a free video game for the PC released in 2002. Years after the game got released, some enthusiastic programmers asked us to open source it and here we are!

A few things to keep in mind:
- this was writen when we were still students so the code quality and the (lack of) architecture can be disturbing
- the code is mostly written in a terrible mix of french and english, which should be kind of akward to read for non french speaking people (actually, it's kind of awkward even for french people! :p )
- the various editors can be quite complicated to get working because they relied on various cryptic INI files
