# Forker's notes

I am mainly trying to modernize the code. Both in terms of C++ features, and
features (mainly trying not to lock the game in 640x480, adding a few shaders
and stuff).

As the code is kinda old, there's a lot of revamping to do, and a lot of
optimizations done back in the days shouldn't be relevant anymore.

As a french, I can work my way through the code, and although I'll be
translating comments as I skim through it, there are some really funny gems
that I'd rather not translate as they'd break the stupidity that made Blip'n
Blop famous. I would rather have a separate lexicon for the fellas that can't
french.

# Blip'n Blop
This is the source code of Blip'n Blop, a free video game for the PC released in 2002. Years after the game got released, some enthusiastic programmers asked us to open source it and here we are!

A few things to keep in mind:
- this was writen when we were still students so the code quality and the (lack of) architecture can be disturbing
- the code is mostly written in a terrible mix of french and english, which should be kind of akward to read for non french speaking people (actually, it's kind of awkward even for french people! :p )
- the various editors can be quite complicated to get working because they relied on various cryptic INI files
