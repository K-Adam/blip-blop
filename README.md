This is the source code of Blip'n Blop, a free video game for the PC released in 2002. Years after the game got released, some enthusiastic programers asked me to open source it and here we are!

A few things to keep in mind:
- I wrote it when I was still a student so the code quality and the (lack of) architecture can be disturbing
- the code is mostly written in a terrible mix of french and english, which should be kind of akward to read for non french speaking people (actually, it's kind of awkward even for french! :p )
- the various editors can be quite complicated to get working because they relied on various cryptic INI files and the worse thing is that...
- back then we didn't use source control (I know, I know...). It's actually not that much of a deal for the code itself as I wrote like ~90% of the code myself but the asset organization is a complete mess and I haven't included them on the repository.
